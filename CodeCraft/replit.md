## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Web Application Architecture
- **Framework**: Flask with Socket.IO for real-time communication
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 5, JavaScript with Socket.IO client
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket connections for live monitoring data
- **Session Management**: Flask sessions with configurable secret keys

### Desktop Application Architecture
- **GUI Framework**: Tkinter for desktop interface (legacy support)
- **System Tray Integration**: Pystray for background monitoring
- **Cross-platform Support**: Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS

## Key Components

### 1. Monitoring Modules
- **System Monitor** (`monitoring/system_monitor.py`): Tracks running processes, CPU usage, memory consumption
- **Network Monitor** (`monitoring/network_monitor.py`): Monitors network connections and suspicious activity
- **File Monitor** (`monitoring/file_monitor.py`): Watches file system changes using Watchdog library
- **Threat Intelligence** (`monitoring/threat_intel.py`): Integrates with VirusTotal and OTX for malware detection

### 2. Utility Components
- **Encryption Manager** (`utils/encryption.py`): Handles data encryption using Fernet (symmetric encryption)
- **Email Notifier** (`utils/email_notifier.py`): Sends security alerts via email
- **Security Logger** (`utils/logger.py`): Comprehensive logging with rotating file handlers

### 3. Configuration System
- **Default Configuration** (`config/default_config.json`): Centralized configuration management
- **Runtime Configuration**: Dynamic configuration updates without restart
- **Environment Variables**: Support for sensitive data like API keys

## Data Flow

1. **Monitoring Loop**: Continuous monitoring threads collect system data
2. **Alert Generation**: Monitors detect anomalies and generate alerts
3. **Real-time Transmission**: Socket.IO broadcasts alerts to web clients
4. **Notification System**: Email alerts and system notifications
5. **Data Storage**: In-memory storage with file-based logging
6. **Web Dashboard**: Real-time visualization of security status
